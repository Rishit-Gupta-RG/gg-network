# SMP FAQS

### I cannot join server, Minecaft shows server is offline.
Our server is not online for 24/7, we need to turn the server back on when we have to play. The server can be turned on from the [Aternos Dashboard](https://aternos.org).

### Server shows it is online with maximum player limit as 1 and I am unable to connect.
If the maxium player limit shows 1 then the server is not actually online its offline and we have to turn on the server to pla. There's an issue with aternos which shows maxiumum players as 1 when the server is offline. Inorder to overcome this issue while checking sevr status on discord we have implied a fix, now you can just check the status using GG SMP bot with the `!check` command.

### How can I start server myself?
Due to some security reasons the access to turn on server is limited to ol members of SMP. You need [`@Start - Network Perm.`](https://discord.com/channels/817003562663149578/817003564185419792/939019988877078528) role on the dicord server to turn the server on. To obtain it, just create an Aternos account and share your Aternos username with an ss of account in [`#server-help`](https://discord.com/channels/817003562663149578/881022450463297556). After verification you will get [`@Start - Network Perm.`](https://discord.com/channels/817003562663149578/817003564185419792/939019988877078528) role and will be able to start the server. You can also read the docs on aternos about [how you get access](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360026950952-Share-access#:~:text=Enter%20your%20friend%27s%20Aternos%20username,and%20click%20the%20plus%20sign.&text=You%27ll%20see%20a%20list,Start%3A%20start%20the%20server) to turn on server.
